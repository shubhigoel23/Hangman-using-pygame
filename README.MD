# HANGMAN GAME USING PYGAME
Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses. This game has been implemented in python using pygame. It has a text file including all the words. Please make sure to keep all the files in one directory or else it will not work. This game selects any random word from the file and asks you to guess the character for that word. You will get 8 chances to guess a word. when you guess the correct character your chance will not be counted when you guess the wrong character your chance will be reduced by one.

Hope you enjoy this game. Any modification in this game would be highly appreciated.
